## ABSTRACT 1
The concept oft Cloud computing has significantly changed the field of parallel and distributed computing
systems today. Cloud computing enables a wide range of users to access distributed, scalable, virtualized
hardware and/or software infrastructure over the Internet. Load balancing is a methodology to distribute
workload across multiple computers, or other resources over the network links to achieve optimal resource
utilization, maximize throughput, minimum response time, and avoid overload. With recent advent of
technology, resource control or load balancing in cloud computing is main challenging issue. A few
existing scheduling algorithms can maintain load balancing and provide better strategies through efficient
job scheduling and resource allocation techniques as well. In order to gain maximum profits with optimized
load balancing algorithms, it is necessary to utilize resources efficiently. This paper presents a review of a
few load balancing algorithms or technique in cloud computing. The objective of this paper is to identify
qualitative components for simulation in cloud environment and then based on these components, execution
analysis of load balancing algorithms are also presented.


## ABSTRACT 2
Load Balancing is the one of the most important parts of the current virtual environment. In the case of cloud
computing environments there were various challenges are there in the load balancing techniques like security, fault
tolerance etc. Many researchers have been proposed various techniques to improve the load balancing. This paper
describes a survey on load balancing schemes in cloud environments. There were various load balancing techniques are
used in these papers and their corresponding advantages, disadvantages and performance metrics are studied in detail.


## ABSTRACT 3
Cloud Computing is an emerging computing paradigm. It aims to share data, calculations, and service transparently over a
scalable network of nodes. Since Cloud computing stores the data and disseminated resources in the open environment.
So, the amount of data storage increases quickly. In the cloud storage, load balancing is a key issue. It would consume a
lot of cost to maintain load information, since the system is too huge to timely disperse load. Load balancing is one of the
main challenges in cloud computing which is required to distribute the dynamic workload across multiple nodes to ensure
that no single node is overwhelmed. It helps in optimal utilization of resources and hence in enhancing the performance of
the system. A few existing scheduling algorithms can maintain load balancing and provide better strategies through
efficient job scheduling and resource allocation techniques as well. In order to gain maximum profits with optimized load
balancing algorithms, it is necessary to utilize resources efficiently. This paper discusses some of the existing load
balancing algorithms in cloud computing and also their challenges.


## ABSTRACT 4
Load Balancing is essential for efficient operations in distributed environments. As Cloud Computing is growing
rapidly and clients are demanding more services and better
results, load balancing for the Cloud has become a very
interesting and important research area. Many algorithms were
suggested to provide efficient mechanisms and algorithms for
assigning the clientâ€™s requests to available Cloud nodes. These
approaches aim to enhance the overall performance of the Cloud
and provide the user more satisfying and efficient services. In
this paper, we investigate the different algorithms proposed to
resolve the issue of load balancing and task scheduling in Cloud
Computing. We discuss and compare these algorithms to provide
an overview of the latest approaches in the field.


## ABSTRACT 5
Now-a-days cloud computing is the most emerging
technology due to its elasticity of resource provisioning and the
pay-as-you-go pricing model which enables users to pay only
according to their need. As cloud can be accessed anytime and
anywhere through commodity hardware only its demand is
increasing day by day. So it must provide high performance
gain to the user and at the same time must be beneficial for the
Cloud Service Provider (CSP). To achieve this goal many
challenges have to be faced. Load balancing is one of them
which helps the CSP to meet the QoS requirements of the users
and at the same time maximize his profit by optimum use of
the resources. To balance the load in cloud the resources and
workloads must be scheduled in an efficient manner. A variety
of scheduling algorithms are used by load balancers to
determine which backend server to send a request to. The
selected server allocates resources and schedules the job
dynamically on some virtual machine (VM) located on the
same physical machine. It is also the responsibility of the
provider to dynamically reallocate or migrate the VM across
physical machines for workload consolidation and to avoid
over utilization or under utilization of resources. In this paper,
we have discussed different algorithms proposed to resolve the
issue of load balancing and task scheduling in Cloud
Computing. We have mentioned some of their shortcomings
for further development. VM migration issues involved in load
balancing are also described briefly.


## ABSTRACT 6
Cloud computing is emerging as a new paradigm of large-scale
distributed computing. It is a framework for enabling convenient,
on-demand network access to a shared pool of computing
resources. Load balancing is one of the main challenges in cloud
computing which is required to distribute the dynamic workload
across multiple nodes to ensure that no single node is
overwhelmed. It helps in optimal utilization of resources and
hence in enhancing the performance of the system. The goal of
load balancing is to minimize the resource consumption which
will further reduce energy consumption and carbon emission rate
that is the dire need of cloud computing. This determines the
need of new metrics, energy consumption and carbon emission
for energy-efficient load balancing in cloud computing. This
paper discusses the existing load balancing techniques in cloud
computing and further compares them based on various
parameters like performance, scalability, associated overhead etc.
that are considered in different techniques. It further discusses
these techniques from energy consumption and carbon emission
perspective.


## ABSTRACT 7
Cloud computing is emerging technology which is a new standard of large scale distributed computing and parallel computing. It provides
shared resources, information, software packages and other resources as per client requirements at specific time. As cloud computing is growing rapidly
and more users are attracted towards utility computing, better and fast service needs to be provided. For better management of available good load
balancing techniques are required. So that load balancing in cloud becoming more interested area of research. And through better load balancing in
cloud, performance is increased and user gets better services. Here in this paper we have discussed many different load balancing techniques used to
